# FEED INDIA - An webpage that connects NGO and volunteers

<b> PROBLEM STATEMENT </b>

India has been grappling with the problem of zero hunger for decades, with millions of people facing food insecurity and malnutrition. Despite various government initiatives and interventions, the issue persists due to factors such as poverty, inequality, and lack of access to resources , whereas the food in the resturant is getting wasted.
All they need are volunteers and support from the resturant's co-operation to getting that wasted food.
Our website acts as an intermediary between an NGO and an individual resturant willing to contribute, thus easing out connectivity and accessibility.

<b> PROPOSED SOLUTION </b>

The Website asks users to register giving them options to log in as an NGO or as a Resturant and a special donate button for those who want to help with their money.
It first lists down the NGOs at a particular location giving access to two types of users of our app ie,<br>
1.Resturants<br>
2.Volunteer<br>
Resturants: A profile is made that allows resturant to upload the details of their remaining food and the location of the pick up point with contact details.
The resturants gets access to create, edit and update their food stock and pick up point details .<br>

Volunteer: A volunteer gets in to browse information about different pick up points with number of food packets in sorted manner according to the location.This view has two features
Chat Support/Helpdesk- This helps the volunteer to resolve any kind of queries.<br>

Contributor- This feature allows a doner to fill in personal details and donate fund for well being of people.<br>

<br>

<b> FUNCTIONALITY AND CONCEPTS USED </b>

- FIREBASE AUTHENTICATION: The login and signup functionality of the app is implemented using the firebase authentication. Each valid user is allowed to create an account with the help of the email and password and can log back in with the same credentials.<br>
- Room Database: The user details are stored using Room Database.Also, it is used for user authentication.<br>
- GPS Navigation system: We use GPS navigation system for convinience of the volenteer to reach the right location of pick up and delivery location.<br>






<b> APPLICATION AND FUTURE SCOPE </b>


- The website is yet to be modified to be used in a broader spectrum. We are planning to making a mobile app for this as well.<br>
- The work of connecting resturant with NGOs is not done yet and the concept and code present only on the website only.<br>
- You can access our website by link here:
visit <a href="https://goutam-04.github.io/GDSC/Zero%20Hunger/">Feed India</a>
<br>
We wish to further work on improvising our webpage, add some advanced features like use of adhaar validation api, learn about food conservation page and many more things. Further,we plan to collaborate with a few local NGOs so that it can be widely used serving the purpose.<br>
We aim to associate our website with the National Service Scheme(NSS) group at our University who will be responsible for testing and providing us with improved scalability thus making our website ready for a robust launch to be service-ready.<br>
The concept with the website is definitely going to help the NGOs connect with resturants helping towards filling the  empty stomach of hungry person.
