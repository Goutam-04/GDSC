                        <li>Firstly NGOs will have to register themselves on our website and have to choose a particular locality where they would like to operate. By which they will get some dropspots/ distribution centers in that particular locality.</li><br><br>
                        <li>Restaurants are required to register themselves on our website by which they can get details of a proper step by step process of packing .
                            For example : Packing portion,size, way of packaging etc.
                            Then they can move on to the donate option where they can add the respective location of pickup along with the number of packets.</li><br><br>

            <h2>PROBLEMS AND THEIR SOLUTIONS</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The question that arises in everybody's mind that why would the restaurants be even intrested in giving extra food?<br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Here, I have a solution of it by giving extra food they don't have to manage the problem of food wastage they can promote themselves through their well - packaging . Moreover , we can arrange some certification process for these good which will surely boost to their reputation.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        What if one gets more than their need ?<br><br>
                        <ul><li>
                            Well, is problem wouldn't arise because the food packets will be divided in such position that it would be sufficient for every kind of age groups or for any kind of appetite size.
                        </li></ul>
                    </li><br><br>
                    <li>Well everyone woulld be thinking what if one takes multiple packets food?<br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For that , everyone are required to bring their respective aadhar card by which verification process will be done using scanner and then they are offered the food packets.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li><br><br>
                </ul>

            </p>
            <p>Note : Due to scanning system only one can get food once through their aadhar card in that particular time frame.
